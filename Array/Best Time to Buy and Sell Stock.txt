// Create a variable buy which will kept the min value and diff which will kept the diff bw buy and current value. m will keep the max difference till now.

class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int buy=prices[0];
        int diff=0;
        int m=Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        boolean flag=false;
        for(int i=1; i<prices.length;i++){
            if(prices[i]<buy){
                buy=prices[i];
            }else{
                flag=true;
                diff=prices[i]-buy;
                m=Math.max(m, diff);
